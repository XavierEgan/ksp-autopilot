MATH:
    LATLONG
        - A way to do math and calculations in xy (tangent to kerbin) plane and easily convert to latlong coords
        - although this may be several km off what i expect when we are far out, the error gets smaller as we get closer to the center (the start of the runway so it doesnt matter)

    PID
        - simple pid with anti windup that i tune manually
        - Ziegler-Nichols was more trouble than its worth before

        anti windup is like this
        accumulated += (error + const * (clamp(out) - out)) * dt

        for example if out is 10 and gets clamped to 1
        accumulated += (error + -9 * const) * dt

BASIC_PLANE_CONTROL:
    Values that are animated by higher order flight control
        - Turn Rate D/s
        - Speed m/s
        - Asc/Desc Rate m/s

OVERALL_CONTROL_VIEW:
    this is a view of the control loops

        Track + localiser -> Turn Rate -> Roll
        Track -> Turn Rate -> Roll
        Altitude -> Asc/Desc Rate -> Pitch
        Flare -> Asc/Desc Rate -> Pitch
        Speed -> Thrust

FLIGHT_PHASES:
    - takeoff
    - flight
    - intercept Localiser
    - Flare
    - rollout

    distinct phases for climb, cruise and descent are borderline useless because the phases all do the same thing lmao

AUTOPILOT
    state machine

CONVENTIONS:
    meters per second = mps
    meter seconds = ms
